This was followed by creation of data for the various entities, then writing a series of SQL queries to test the outputs. In the end, a report is provided for each milestone. The milestones are 1,2 and 3. In the last milestone, the final project and corresponding report is provided with all the codes and dump files. Visualizations created in tableau are also provided. The final query system is run using a graphical user interface (Tinkiter GUI in python). Mysql from python is also as an interface between python and the MySQL database for query operations. Identical queries are also run in MySQL workbench. A document on how to run the codes is included in the files named python instruction document
